This is something which a lot of people get confused about, and fairly so. With SO many resources around us, it often does get overwhelming. But according to me, the right start is what decides how much money you’re going to make in the markets in your life… got you didn’t I? 

No, it’s not, investing and trading is like a marathon, no one who sprints right at the start is destined to win, but a good start sure does help.
                     
Now, coming to the main part, how should you start?
                     
There are two divisions here: Trading & Investing. And two methods of analysis: Fundamental or Technical Analysis. Too simplify it on the most basic level, the difference between trading and investing is in the timeline. Stock trading is about buying and selling shares for short-term profit, such as within a week or a day. Investing refers to buying and selling stocks for long-term gains, such as within months or years.
Coming to the method of analysis, Technical analysis involves evaluating securities by analysing statistics generated by market activity, such as past prices and volume. The idea is to identify patterns and trends that can suggest future movements. Fundamental analysis evaluates securities by attempting to measure their intrinsic value. Analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies.
Now, as a person who is just starting out, what should you do?
                     
My suggestion is:
  •	Start with Fundamental Analysis: Understanding the basics of how companies operate and are valued is crucial. This foundational knowledge can help you make informed long-term investment decisions.
  •	Incorporate Technical Analysis: Once comfortable with fundamental analysis, adding technical analysis can help refine timing for buying and selling, especially for more active trading strategies. 

According to me it’s very essential to get your basics right first, and you can decide what to do, but my suggestion would be to start with Zerodha’s Varsity course first.
<img src="images/b2-pic1.png">
It’s a free resource, available in both English and Hindi, and I suggest you to go through the first three modules first, which are:
  1.	Introduction to Stock Markets
  2.	Technical Analysis
  3.	Fundamental Analysis

This should not take more than a week or two to complete, and after this, you’ll get a very good idea of what you’re getting into.

Alongside these modules, you should start reading a few books about the stock market and how it works, and different trading strategies. I can assure you, there are some great ones out there.

My suggestion would be to start with One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch, a very very famous book. This book will be a little challenging to start, but who doesn’t like a good challenge? This book will sure as hell give you a lot of confidence that investing is for everyone, and that anyone can do it on their own. It will show you that investing methods and strategies don’t need to filled with complex excel models and that the beauty of investing lies in its simplicity.

Now after doing all this, you must’ve realized that theory can only take you so far. To start investing, you will need to open a Demat and trading account. A Demat account holds your securities in electronic form, making the process of buying, selling, and transferring shares seamless. A trading account is used to place buy and sell orders in the stock market. Most major banks and financial institutions in India offer these services, and it’s wise to compare their features and fees before choosing one. I personally use Zerodha and it’s been pretty convenient but of course, the choice is yours.

After setting up your accounts, start with small investments. This approach allows you to gain practical experience without risking a significant amount of money. As you become more comfortable and knowledgeable, you can gradually diversify your portfolio and explore other investment opportunities.
Also, if you for some reason don’t want to/can’t open an account at the moment, you can try trading with fake money, which is called paper trading. Paper trading involves simulating trades without using real money and can be a useful way to practice and refine your strategies without any financial risk. Have a look at Moneybhai for the same.

It's crucial to keep educating yourself as you progress. Subscribe to financial news, read market analysis, and consider joining online forums or investment group. Have a look at Finshots, ValuePickr, Value Investors Club and MarketSmith India. These are some of the best ones out there. Also, I’m pretty sure that some of the best books in the world are written on the subject of Finance, so a few book suggestions I have are:
  1.	The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel – Personal Finance
  2.	Diamonds in the Dust by Saurabh Mukherjea, Rakshit Ranjan, Salil Desai – Specifically for the Indian Scenario
  3.	The Dhandho Investor by Mohnish Pabrai – Also Specifically of the Indian Scenario
  4.	One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch – Investing Style

At this point, you yourself will have a very decent idea of what to do next. But to get started, this is enough.

Finally, be patient and stay disciplined. Investing and trading are not get-rich-quick schemes. They require time, effort, knowledge and to some extent luck as well :) Hopefully you are ready to put in the first three and be assured, the fourth will follow.

All the best for this rollercoaster ride, sit tight and enjoy!
